This Game is a simple top-down maze where you play as an alien. The goal of the game is to escape the spaceship while a astronaut tries to capture you. Colliding with the astronaut results in an immediate game over. In order to escape, you need to power on all three generators located around the map in order to open the exit door.

# Controls
WASD (or arrow keys) for movement
Shift for Sprint

# Assets
I created most of the assets myself using Procreate. The png realistic space backgrounds were found on pixibay: The game success background from user MasterTux and background used for the main scene and game over screen from user qimono.
